# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Multi-Agent IDE desktop application is currently failing to start properly due to missing asset files, specifically tray icons and app icons. The application expects these assets to be present in an `assets/icons` directory, but this directory and its contents are missing from the project structure. This causes unhandled promise rejections and prevents the application from initializing correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Multi-Agent IDE desktop application to start without errors, so that I can use the application for development tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load all required icon assets without errors
2. WHEN the tray manager initializes THEN the system SHALL display the system tray icon correctly
3. WHEN the main window is created THEN the system SHALL display the application icon in the window title bar and taskbar
4. IF an icon file is missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the error and continue initialization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application assets to be properly organized and accessible, so that the build process can include them in the final distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL include all asset files in the distribution
2. WHEN assets are referenced in code THEN the system SHALL use correct relative paths that work in both development and production
3. WHEN the application is packaged THEN the system SHALL ensure all assets are accessible to the Electron main process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want appropriate fallback behavior when assets are missing, so that the application remains functional even if some assets are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tray icon is missing THEN the system SHALL skip tray creation and log a warning
2. WHEN an app icon is missing THEN the system SHALL use the default system icon and log a warning
3. WHEN any asset loading fails THEN the system SHALL NOT crash or show unhandled promise rejections
4. WHEN assets are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging
