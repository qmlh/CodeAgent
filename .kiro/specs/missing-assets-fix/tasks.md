# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create assets directory structure and placeholder icons




  - Create `assets/icons/` directory in project root
  - Generate placeholder icon files for all required icons (tray-icon.ico, tray-icon.png, app-icon.png, status icons)
  - Use simple geometric shapes or text-based placeholders that are visible on both light and dark backgrounds
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_
- [ ] 2. Update TrayManager to handle missing assets gracefully







- [ ] 2. Update TrayManager to handle missing assets gracefully

  - Modify `getTrayIconPath()` method to check file existence before returning path
  - Update `createTray()` method to skip tray creation if icon is missing and log warning
  - Replace error throwing with graceful fallback behavior in icon loading
  - Add proper error logging with clear messages about missing assets
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Update WindowManager to handle missing app icons gracefully




  - Modify `getAppIcon()` method to check file existence before loading
  - Return undefined instead of throwing error when app icon is missing
  - Add proper error logging with warning messages for missing app icons
  - Ensure Electron uses system default icon when app icon is unavailable
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.2, 3.3_
-

- [ ] 4. Update webpack configuration to include assets in build



  - Add asset copying configuration to webpack.config.js for main process
  - Ensure assets directory is copied to dist folder during build
  - Configure proper asset paths that work in both development and production environments
  - Test that assets are accessible in the built application
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
-

- [x] 5. Add error handling to prevent unhandled promise rejections




  - Wrap asset loading operations in try-catch blocks
  - Replace any unhandled promise rejections with proper error handling
  - Ensure all async operations in TrayManager and WindowManager have error handling
  - Add proper error boundaries for asset-related operations
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Test application startup and asset loading




  - Write unit tests for asset path resolution and error handling
  - Create integration tests for application startup with missing assets
  - Test tray creation and window creation with various asset availability scenarios
  - Verify application starts without errors and handles missing assets gracefully
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_
