# Multi-Agent IDE

A collaborative IDE with multiple AI agents working together on software development projects.

## Overview

This system enables multiple specialized AI agents to collaborate on software development tasks, each with different expertise areas such as frontend development, backend development, testing, code review, and documentation.

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture consisting of:

- **Core Layer**: Interfaces, types, and fundamental system components
- **Agent Layer**: Specialized AI agents for different development tasks
- **Service Layer**: Task management, file management, messaging, and coordination services
- **UI Layer**: Desktop application built with Electron and React
