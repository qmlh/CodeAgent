## Features Implemented

### ✅ File System Access and Operations
- Local file system access and manipulation

- Bulk file operations with progress tracking
- File validation and error handling

### ✅ File Tree Component
- Hierarchical display of project files and folders
- Expand/collapse functionality for directories
- File type icons and visual indicators
- Search and filtering capabilities

### ✅ File Operations
- Drag and drop support for file management
- Context menus for common operations
- File import from external sources
- System file dialog integration

### ✅ File Preview System
- Text file preview with syntax highlighting
- Image file preview
- Binary file detection and handling
- File metadata display

### ✅ Real-time File Monitoring
- File system event monitoring and notifications
- Real-time updates to file tree
- Event filtering and debouncing
- Performance optimization

### ✅ Advanced File Search
- File name and content search
- File type filtering
- Search result highlighting
- Multiple search criteria support

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Event-driven architecture** for real-time updates
- **Service layer** for file operations with progress tracking
- **React hooks** for state management and event handling
- **Redux integration** for global state management

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced file system events** to prevent excessive updates
- **Virtual scrolling** for large file lists
- **Lazy loading** of directory contents
- **Efficient file watching** with configurable options

### Error Handling
- **Comprehensive error handling** for all file operations
- **User-friendly error messages** and recovery suggestions
- **Validation** for file names and operations
- **Graceful degradation** for unsupported operations

### Testing
- **Unit tests** for individual components
- **Integration tests** for file system operations
- **Mock services** for testing without file system access
- **Test utilities** for common testing scenarios

## Usage Examples

### Basic File Tree Usage
```tsx
import { FileTree } from './FileTree';

<FileTree
  files={fileTree}
  selectedFile={selectedFile}
  expandedDirectories={expandedDirectories}
  onFileSelect={handleFileSelect}
  onDirectoryExpand={handleDirectoryExpand}
  // ... other handlers
  workspacePath={currentWorkspace}
/>
```

### File Operations Service Usage
```typescript
import { fileOperationsService } from '../services/FileOperationsService';

// Create a file with validation
const operationId = await fileOperationsService.createFile('/path/to/file.txt', 'content');

// Listen for operation progress
fileOperationsService.on('operationUpdated', (operation) => {
  console.log(`Operation ${operation.id} progress: ${operation.progress}%`);
});
```

### File System Events Hook Usage
```tsx
import { useFileSystemEvents } from '../hooks/useFileSystemEvents';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isWatching, refreshWatcher } = useFileSystemEvents(workspacePath, {
    onFileAdded: (event) => console.log('File added:', event.path),
    onFileChanged: (event) => console.log('File changed:', event.path),
  });

  return <div>Watching: {isWatching ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</div>;
};
```

## Integration with Main Application

The file system integration is designed to be used within the main IDE application:

1. **ExplorerPanel** can be embedded in the sidebar
2. **FileManager** provides the complete file management interface
3. **Services** can be used throughout the application for file operations
4. **Hooks** provide easy integration with React components

## Future Enhancements

- **Git integration** for version control operations
- **File comparison** and diff viewing
- **Advanced search** with regex support
- **File templates** for common file types
- **Workspace-specific settings** and preferences
- **Plugin system** for custom file operations

## Dependencies

- **React** - UI framework
- **Ant Design** - UI component library
- **React DnD** - Drag and drop functionality
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **EventEmitter3** - Event handling
- **Electron** - Desktop application framework

## Performance Considerations

- File operations are performed asynchronously to prevent UI blocking
- Large directories are loaded incrementally
- File watching is optimized to minimize resource usage
- Event debouncing prevents excessive re-renders
- Memory usage is monitored and optimized for large workspaces
