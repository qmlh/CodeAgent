## Requirements Satisfied

- **3.1**: Real-time monitoring of agent work status ✅
- **3.2**: Error notifications and intervention capabilities ✅
- **3.3**: Work history and contribution statistics ✅
- **5.1**: Agent message passing mechanisms ✅
- **8.3**: Real-time activity timeline and detailed work logs ✅
- **8.4**: Real-time status updates and notifications ✅

## Usage

```tsx
import { CollaborationView } from './components/collaboration';

// Basic usage
<CollaborationView />

// With custom styling
<CollaborationView 
  className="custom-collaboration"
  style={{ height: '100vh' }}
/>
```

## Architecture

The collaboration interface follows a modular architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React components with Ant Design UI
2. **State Management**: Redux store integration
3. **Real-time Layer**: Event service with WebSocket-like functionality
4. **Data Layer**: Agent and message state management

## Testing

All components are thoroughly tested with Jest and React Testing Library:

```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern="CollaborationView.test.tsx"
```

## Future Enhancements

- WebSocket integration for true real-time updates
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Export functionality for activity logs
- Integration with external monitoring tools
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
